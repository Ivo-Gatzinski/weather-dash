## Description

This is a simple weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. It displays the weather for the day, as well as a five-day forecast, for any city or place around the world.

It uses the [OpenWeather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) to retrieve weather data for cities. 

It also uses the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time.
